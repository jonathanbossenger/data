# How to Contribute

First off, thanks for the interest! ðŸš€

Submitting your own post is a simple process, all you have to do is create a Pull Request with the proposed changes. There isn't a set template for a post as we'd like to have people express their own personality and styls in the content, for inspiration check out the [prompts.md](/prompts.md) file, or one of the existing posts.

A few notes:

* The folder name in posts will map to the url of the post, e.g. `data/posts/n1c/post.md` becomes wemakewith.com/n1c.
* The post's title and published date are defined in the post yaml front matter.
* Make sure your image urls are relative to the current folder e.g. `images/main.png`.
