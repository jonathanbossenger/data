> Feel free to pick and choose from these somewhat-themed paragraphs. Don’t feel any pressure to include all of it; this post is supposed to be about you and not about a template! For all the little questions assume there’s also a follow up of “any particular reason for this choice” where you can expound a bit on why you use what you do. Maybe for comfort, familiarity, efficiency etc.

Introduce yourself, who are you, what do you do? Feel free to mention your startup, project, day job, etc.

Set the scene for how you like to work, do you rise early? Meditate? Do you work in an office, at home, anywhere? Are you fussy, flexible, particular?

> Some people like to walk about the “lowest level” things first like settings, terminal, ide etc. Others like to start from the big stuff: room, desk, etc. Trust your gut.

Do you have a private office? Fancy lights? A particular desk, or how things are arranged in your space?

What sort of hardware do you use? Monitors, keyboard, mouse, headphones, machine? Any other miscellaneous peripherals you can’t live without?

Let’s get a little more nitty gritty, OS, IDE, terminal, design apps? Do you track time? Any interesting habits like Promodo etc?

Some people like to talk about their phone, is it setup in a special way? What does your home screen look like? Any apps you can’t live without?

Any final thoughts? Where can we find you on the internet?
