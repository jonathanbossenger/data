# Jonathan

Hi, my name is Jonathan and I am a freelance web developer. You can read more about me on my [blog](https://jonathanbossenger.com).

When I originally went freelance I tried working from home with my two boys (then aged 1 and 4). This didnt last long, and since September 2017 I've been renting a small office space about 5 minutes from where I live.

It's great because I get my own space, and the commute takes me directly past a Vida, Xpresso and Seattle, so I can mix up my morning coffee flavours.

My desk is a 2nd hand adjustable desk and I have an AllOffice Accent chair, which is a cost effective ergonomic office chair. Next to my desk I have a small fridge and coffee making requirements.

Even though I’m an old man now my setup is still heavily inspired by my “minimalist gamer” sensibilities. I’ve found the Coolermaster CMStorm QuickFire Cherry MX Red Mechanical Keyboard and the Rival 100 a great combination of solid without being gaudy. I’ve never been a fan of backlit / LED products.

I like to try and have my IDE and Terminal look as similar as possible. They both use a Solarized Light theme with the Anonymous Pro font. For code I use Microsoft’s VSCode and a relatively default zsh terminal.

I don’t use too many VSCode plugins of note, except maybe the Vim bindings and a bunch of PHP/JS/TS linters.

My phone setup is also super-simple. I try avoid using it as much as possible other than occasionally checking on Instagram and listening to podcasts with a pair of AirPods and the Overcast app. I was really skeptical about the AirPods at first but they’re a really seamless experience and it feels so easy to just pop them in when I need them I listen to a lot more now than with “traditional” headphones.

I’m really happy with how simple my setup is at the moment, switching between Ubuntu and MacOS has been rather straightforward with most of the tools I use daily being either cross platform or just web based and going from zero to 1 on a new system is really quick with just a few Dropbox’d config files.
