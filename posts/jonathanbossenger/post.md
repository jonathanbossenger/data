# Jonathan

Hi, my name is Jonathan and I am a freelance web developer. You can read more about me on my [blog](https://jonathanbossenger.com).

When I originally went freelance I tried working from home with my two boys (then aged 1 and 4). This didn't last long, and since September 2017 I've been working out of a small office space about 5 minutes from where I live.

It's great because I get my own space, and the commute takes me directly past a Vida, Xpresso and Seattle, so I can mix up my morning coffee flavours.

The other great advantage of my office is that it's actually part of my in-laws home office, which means I get to enjoy their pool whenever the summer sun get's too much.

My desk is a 2nd hand adjustable desk and I have an AllOffice Accent chair, which is a cost effective ergonomic office chair. Next to my desk I have a small fridge and coffee making requirements.

Workstation peripherals include a Dell 27 inch LED, my 7 year old Samsung 23 inch Syncmaster and a Philips 24 inch monitor I picked up recently. I'm a bit of a Logitech fan boy, so my wireless mouse, keyboard, 2.1 speakers and headset are all Logitech products, purchased at separate times over the course of the last 10 years or so.

Under the desk is a custom built workstation, powered by a MSI x470 gaming motherboard, 6 core AMD Ryzen 5 2600x, 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a Zotac Geforce GTX 1060. Storage is taken care of by 2 128 GB M.2 SSD hard drives dual booting Ubuntu and Windows, with 2 x 1 TB hard drives for storage for each OS. 

My main OS is Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, and I generally stick to the LTS version unless something cool is coming out on a newer version. The Windows 10 install is mostly for gaming (those games that don't work via Steam on Linux) or if I need to test something in a true Windows environment.

I like to try and have my IDE and Terminal look as similar as possible. They both use a Solarized Light theme with the Anonymous Pro font. For code I use Microsoft’s VSCode and a relatively default zsh terminal.

I don’t use too many VSCode plugins of note, except maybe the Vim bindings and a bunch of PHP/JS/TS linters.

My phone setup is also super-simple. I try avoid using it as much as possible other than occasionally checking on Instagram and listening to podcasts with a pair of AirPods and the Overcast app. I was really skeptical about the AirPods at first but they’re a really seamless experience and it feels so easy to just pop them in when I need them I listen to a lot more now than with “traditional” headphones.

I’m really happy with how simple my setup is at the moment, switching between Ubuntu and MacOS has been rather straightforward with most of the tools I use daily being either cross platform or just web based and going from zero to 1 on a new system is really quick with just a few Dropbox’d config files.
