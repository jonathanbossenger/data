# Etienne Marais

I find a lot of inspiration from seeing how other developers and designers work. Borrowing from the way they setup their environment gives an interesting flair to the way I work but also being able to tweak that makes me feel great. I am a Full-Stack web developer and this is what I use to build applications using Laravel/VueJS and Docker.

## Editor

I use [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm) as my main editor and I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as my secondary editor. For PHPStorm I use a tweaked version of the [Zeus theme](http://www.phpstorm-themes.com/theme/zeus) with [Source code pro for powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/SourceCodePro) as the font and lots of line spacing:

    font-size: 15
    line-spacing: 1.9

I use [Nightowl](https://github.com/sdras/night-owl-vscode-theme) for my VSCode theme with the same font settings.
