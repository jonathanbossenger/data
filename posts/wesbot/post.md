# Wes Bos Uses

Everyday I get a few emails asking about the specifics of some piece of software or hardware I use.

I change up things fairly often, so this page will serve as a living document and a place to point curious developers to when I get asked.

If there is something missing leave a comment below or ask in my [AMA](https://github.com/wesbos/ama) â€” happy to chat and help you figure out your own situation.

## Editor + Terminal

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor which I switched to in September 2017 after years of Sublime Text.
* [Sublime Text](http://sublimetext.com/3dev) V3 beta is used in most of my video tutorials â€” I write more about my setup in [my book](http://sublimetextbook.com/).
* I created a theme called Cobalt2 for [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2), [Sublime Text](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Theme%20-%20Cobalt2) and [iTerm2](https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm) v3 which I use.
* Iâ€™m currently using [Operator Mono](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview/) for a font. Yes I paid the $200 for it. Before that I used [Inconsolata](https://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) for many years.
* I use Operator Mono in Sublime, iTerm2 (with [these settings](https://wes.io/fYY8)), and in Chrome Dev tools with [Dev Tools Author](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/devtools-author/egfhcfdfnajldliefpdoaojgahefjhhi).
* The cursive font you see is just the italic weight of Operator Mono. Your theme must have italics in it for it to work â€“ my Cobalt2 uses italics heavily.
* Iâ€™m currently switching over to [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) for my terminal.
* The JavaScript suggestions you see in my videos is called [JavaScript Completions](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/JavaScript%20Completions) â€“ you might have to play with the settings to get it to not popup some of the node completions.
* You can see most of my config files (.eslint, VS Code settings) over at my [Dot Files repo](https://github.com/wesbos/dotfiles) but please donâ€™t just take these settings carte blanche â€“ they work for me but might not be the best.

## Desktop Apps

* I use [Text Expander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander) for canned responses and for most of my code snippets.
* Iâ€™m a huge [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) fan and have many [workflows](https://wes.io/fY7q).
* I use [Things App](https://culturedcode.com/things/) with a [GTD mindset](http://gettingthingsdone.com/) for managing my tasks.
* I design almost entirely in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/).
* I backup with 2 time machines local HDDs, [Dropbox](http://dropbox.com/) for most files, and [BackBlaze](https://secure.backblaze.com/r/008x60) for my entire hard drive.
* I write in Sublime Text and use [Marked](http://marked2app.com/) to preview. I have an [entire series](https://masteringmarkdown.com/) about this.
* The cool Emoji picker you see me use in my videos is [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/).

## Recording

* I use [ScreenFlow](https://www.telestream.net/screenflow/) to record and edit my screencasts.
* I wrote about my [animated gif workflow here](https://wesbos.com/animated-gif-workflow/).
* My mic is a [Heil PR40](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SOYOTQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SOYOTQ&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=YH6ZR6GSGBI2JOJF) on a [PL2T boom arm](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SZVZ74/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000SZVZ74&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=HJ6K3KRLOL5XJJSC). Many of my videos were recorded on the cheaper but still amazing [AT2020](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006H92QK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B0006H92QK&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=PHY64E6Y43GHI55T).
* I use a [DBX286s](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004LWH79A/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B004LWH79A&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=E3KFCLCQIXXLC7W4) to do almost all my audio compression and processing as a I record and pipe it into my computer with a [Focusrite 2i2](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005OZE9SA/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005OZE9SA&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=ELZASVHMTR6ZTNYL).
* My webcam is a [Logitech HD Pro c920](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=webo080-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B006JH8T3S&linkId=65a64ee5dd16f2fa18faf2f2d33d0538).
* All this gear is pretty demanding, so I use an [Amazon Basics 10 Port USB Hub](http://amzn.to/2kVaDCz) to make it all work at once while only having to plug in a single cable.

## Desk Setup

* My main monitor is a 32â€³ 4k [LG 32ud59](https://amzn.to/2SYuX8G).
* To my right I run a vertical 27â€³ 4k [Dell 4k P2715Q](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PC9HFO8/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00PC9HFO8&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=5VCVP6ZUPF5GLCUJ) and an open loaded macbook pro nested on a [Rain mStand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000OOYECC&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=XWDACWNC2JWRF3DQ).
* I sit on a [polished aluminum Herman Miller aeron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LTAO8S/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000LTAO8S&linkCode=as2&tag=webo080-20&linkId=6G4M6ZR4CYKT3TM5).
* My desk is an [8 foot oak butcher block countertop](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/products/20274961/) on legs.
* Here is a [photo of my setup](https://twitter.com/wesbos/status/1060643936140738560).
* Everything â€” Monitors, Ethernet, Hard Drives, Webcam, and Power â€” is plugged in via a single USB cable and piped into my [Caldigit TS3 Plus](https://amzn.to/2D9Jnx0) â€“ This is a pretty sweet setup!

## Other Gear

* After a lengthy search for the perfect backpack for both traveling and schlepping gear around the city I bought the [Peak Design Everyday Backpack 30L](http://amzn.to/2kHB4kc) and itâ€™s incredible (and very expensive ðŸ˜‘).
